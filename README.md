# Lab 8

For this lab you will be accessing fake photo data via REST using fetch from your Express NodeJS server. Your server will serve a route to retrieve all photo data, or a single photo data. The website includes 5,000 photo data items, but for brevity your server will only return the first 20.

Lab goals and outcomes:

    Part 1: Create lab file and initialize Node.js folder
    Part 2: Install Express package
    Part 3: Add server starter code
    Part 4: Explore JSONPlaceholder website and photos data structure, and fetch data using browser
    Part 5: Fetch(), chaining, and JavaScript promises to handle asynchronous operations
    Part 6: Update routes to retrieve photo data using NodeJS and fetch
    Part 7: Use AI to generate client code (index.html, script.js, style.css) to interact with your server, and update server to serve client files from a public subfolder.

This lab was a great hands-on experience combining **server-side logic**, **external data handling**, and a basic **client interface**. laying a foundation for full-stack API development in future projects.
